Failed to connect to MongoDB: Could not connect to any servers in your MongoDB Atlas cluster. One common reason is that you're trying to access the database from an IP that isn't whitelisted. Make sure your current IP address is on your Atlas cluster's IP whitelist: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-whitelist/
Configured MONGODB_URI: mongodb+srv://kashish:maheshwari@cluster0.yaqamjh.mongodb.net
If you are using MongoDB Atlas, make sure your IP is whitelisted and the connection string is correct.
